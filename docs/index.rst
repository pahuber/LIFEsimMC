LIFEsimMC Documentation
=======================

**LIFEsimMC** is a Monte Carlo-based end-to-end simulator for the `Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) <https://life-space-mission.com/>`_.
It has been developed to support trade studies and requirement derivations for LIFE, in particular in the context of instrumental (instability) noise. It
allows the generation of synthetic nulling data and incorporates a suite of processing and analysis tools for their interpretation.
