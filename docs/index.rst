LIFEsimMC Documentation
=======================

**LIFEsimMC** is a Monte Carlo-based end-to-end simulator for the `Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) <https://life-space-mission.com/>`_
and has been developed to support trade studies and requirement derivations for LIFE in the context of `instrumental (instability) noise`.
It is capable of generating synthetic nulling data and incorporates a suite of processing and analysis tools for their interpretation.

Please cite `Huber et al. 2025 <https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/adfb6b>`_ and `LIFEsimMC - End-to-End Simulations for the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16615384>`_ if you use *LIFEsimMC* in your research.
